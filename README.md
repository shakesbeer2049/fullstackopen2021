-> I tried to make different folders for each exercise , for example , 1.2 and 1.1 were kept in different folders. It became cumbersome after that and i took the advice of course instructor to code in the same file "since we are only interested in the final state of the submitted application"

-> So folder 1.2 also contains code for exercises after that
